**FORCE2019 Research Software Hackathon**

**Data quality and curation track**



**Description:**

Many stakeholders have established institutional best practices when dealing with software as a research output. These guidelines provide a way to improve data quality and facilitate curation. Sometimes the guidelines also provide mechanism or instructions for better software citation.

It is important to compare the existing guidelines and see the commonalities and differences
for future evolutions.

**Expected outcomes:**

- Align guidelines: identify commonalities and differences
- Identify key points for consideration when dealing with quality curation

## Meeting Notes:

Enter your info into this sheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HLH1icoT6BT1sj1CifXMStmryitbCOnn8Uxe8Gc6R6c/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HLH1icoT6BT1sj1CifXMStmryitbCOnn8Uxe8Gc6R6c/edit?usp=sharing)

### Outcomes:
The guidelines comparison is accessible on [software_best_practices_crosswalk.csv](software_best_practices_crosswalk.csv)

- Align guidelines:  
    - identify commonalities  
        - Most of guidelines are for Author
        - Most of them recommend identifiers
        - License recommendation for openness   
    - identify Differences
        - They seem to have different audiences/use cases in mind,
        some are citing software created by others, some are on steps
        to share your own software
        - Granularity in guidelines varies, some are more high level than others
        - Only a limited number of vocabularies referred to e.g.
        [https://spdx.org/](https://spdx.org/) for licences
        - Some guidelines have reviewed or moderated for metadata but not all
- Identify key points for consideration when dealing with quality curation  


#### Meta points on creating guidelines in general
- Don’t hide your guidelines in published papers or presentations,
    a well designed webpage that works as a standalone resource
- Be explicit in whom your targeting with your guidelines and what their
    motivations are for reading (and yours for writing a guide)  

#### Considerations for quality curation
- Provenance information
- Persistent identifier - unique per version
- Consider resources necessary for replicability - do you need containers,
VM’s, archived libraries, etc.
